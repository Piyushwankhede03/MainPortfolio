    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a passionate Frontend Developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean and responsive web interfaces. I work mainly with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I love building UI designs that feel clean, fast, and user-friendly. I’ve created multiple projects using modern React concepts, API integration, and Git/GitHub for version control. I’m constantly improving my skills, learning new concepts every day, and looking for an opportunity where I can contribute, grow, and build real-world products with a great team.
